A simple genetic algorithm example using MATLAB.

Problem: find a solution to maximize an algebraic function for an n-bit number

This is a trivial problem with a solution we can solve directly (not an NP problem). This program is meant to illustrate fundamentally how a GA finds solutions, using a simple problem for illustration.
