A simple genetic algorithm example using MATLAB.

Problem: find a solution to maximize an algebraic function for an n-bit number

This is a trivial problem with a solution we can solve directly (not an NP problem). This program is meant to illustrate fundamentally how a GA finds solutions, using a simple problem for illustration.

If there's a package missing error for bin2de() (like you don't have the appropriate toolbox), this function just converts the binary value to the decimal value to get the fitness score. Should be easy to write a binary to decimal function to bypass it.
